# Installation and operations

Detailed setup and lifecycle reference. For the quick start, see [README](../README.md).

## Guided setup

The simple path asks for the installation method, database, access method, address, administrator and optional SMTP settings. Recommended defaults are clearly labeled. The final review shows the choices before installation.

| Question | Choices |
| --- | --- |
| Language | English / Spanish / Brazilian Portuguese |
| Experience | Simple **(Recommended)** / Advanced |
| Panel deployment | **1. Standalone (Recommended)** / 2. Docker |
| Database engine (asked once) | MariaDB **(Recommended)** / MySQL, reused for Panel and game SQL |
| Address | Domain/subdomain **(Recommended)** / machine's public IPv4 |
| Transport | HTTPS recommended for domains; HTTP forced for an IP |
| Administrator | Email, username and hidden password; empty password generates a strong one |
| SMTP | Configure now or later |
| Game database host | Local isolated Docker instance / existing host / configure later (default) |
| Advanced database host | Display name, local port/manager/password, optional existing node ID |
| Advanced only | Panel release, PHP 8.3/8.4 for standalone, HTTP port, IPv4 bind address, timezone |
| Wings deployment | Standalone daemon **(Recommended)** / Docker container |

Generated **administrator** passwords are displayed once before deployment so you can save them in your password manager. They are not written to a credentials file. Database and private Redis passwords are generated automatically and stored in private configuration files.

The public IPv4 default is discovered using HTTPS services (`api.ipify.org`, with `ipv4.icanhazip.com` as fallback). If detection fails, enter the machine's public IPv4 manually. Private/loopback addresses are not silently used as public addresses. A custom IP must actually route to this machine; the installer cannot configure your provider's NAT.

## Deployment choices

| Component | Docker | Standalone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Panel | Official versioned image, pinned to its pulled digest | Verified release archive + PHP 8.3/8.4 + verified Composer 2 |
| Database | MariaDB 11.4 or MySQL 8.4 LTS container, no public DB port | Compatible native MariaDB or MySQL packages; private `ptero_panel` database/user |
| Redis | Redis 7.4 container, no public Redis port | Dedicated password-protected instance on `127.0.0.1:16379` |
| Web server | NGINX in the official Panel image | Managed NGINX site and dedicated PHP-FPM pool |
| Queue / scheduler | Managed inside the official Panel image | Dedicated systemd worker and scheduler timer |
| Wings | Official versioned image with host networking and required host bind mounts | Verified binary and systemd service |

**Wings always requires Docker for game servers**, including when the Panel itself is installed in standalone mode. The Panel never receives the Docker socket. The optional Wings container needs that socket to manage game containers.

Standalone PHP uses distribution packages when the selected PHP version is available, or Ondřej's PHP PPA on Ubuntu / the Sury PHP repository on Debian. Ubuntu 22.04 gets MariaDB 11.4 from MariaDB's repository. Debian MySQL uses Oracle's MySQL 8.4 repository. Native MySQL on Debian is restricted to amd64 because the upstream Debian repository does not publish the required ARM64 packages; use MariaDB or Docker on Debian ARM64.

A pre-existing **different database engine is not replaced**. An existing reserved `ptero_panel` database/user is not adopted without an ownership record. Shared PHP, NGINX and database packages are retained when removing the Panel; only this installer's site, pool, worker, timer and private Redis are managed.

## Supported hosts

Ubuntu **22.04, 24.04, 26.04**, and Debian **12, 13**. Linux with systemd, root access and amd64/arm64. Python 3.10 or newer; no pip dependencies.

At least 4 GiB free space is required. At least 2 GiB RAM is recommended, **plus** your games' memory and room for backups. Wings needs a Docker-capable host; KVM VPSes or dedicated servers are appropriate. OpenVZ/LXC and nested Docker/Podman environments are rejected by its host check.

Use a fresh server for installation. This installer does not automatically adapt an existing reverse proxy or overwrite another installer's Panel/Wings. Existing listeners on the selected Panel ports are detected before deployment.

For HTTPS, your domain's A/AAAA records must point at the server and public TCP 80/443 must be reachable. An incorrect AAAA record can also prevent certificate issuance. IP mode does not request a certificate.

## Game database hosts

The database engine is selected **once**. The Panel gets its own application database and restricted application user. The optional game database host is a separate SQL server: Pterodactyl creates a database and account there **for each game server** when requested. A node itself does not need a single shared game database.

Choose one of three options in either simple or advanced setup:

1. **Local node (isolated game SQL):** choose an isolated native instance (recommended) or a separate, digest-pinned MariaDB/MySQL container. See [native SQL and recovery](ADVANCED.md). The Docker option installs its own project, even when the **Panel is standalone**. This explicit option installs Docker if needed. The privileged provisioning user cannot access the Panel SQL instance. Docker selects a private bridge subnet; SQL publishes only on that bridge's IPv4 gateway, on port 3307 by default. This address works for the native/Docker Panel and game containers on this machine. It does not use the public Panel IP and does not work for remote nodes.
2. **Existing database host:** asks for its reachable hostname/IPv4, port and existing provisioning credentials, then registers it in the Panel. Remote SQL packages, grants, private routing and firewall must already be prepared; the installer does not remotely install software or alter that host. Use the selected MariaDB/MySQL engine there as well.
3. **Configure later (default):** installs the Panel without game SQL. Use menu option 20 later. A simple Panel installation does not acquire another SQL container without choosing it.

The local SQL firewall admits host loopback, Docker's default bridge, standard `br-*` bridges and Wings' default `pterodactyl0` interface. It drops other incoming SQL traffic in both `DOCKER-USER` and `INPUT`, including traffic routed to the private gateway. It does not flush other rules or change SSH/firewall policy. It requires Docker's **iptables** backend with `DOCKER-USER`; setup stops before starting SQL if that backend is unavailable. Custom Wings bridge names need an explicit firewall adaptation. The dedicated `ptero-game-db-firewall.service` reapplies those rules after boot/Docker restart. SQL uses `ptero-game-databases.service`, ordered after the firewall, with Docker restart policy disabled so it cannot automatically start before those rules. Systemd supervises the attached Compose process and recovers a stopped SQL process.

Registration calls Panel v2's own `CreatesDatabaseHosts` contract: it checks the connection and encrypts the password. Repeating setup reuses the local password/image and matches an existing host's settings instead of creating duplicates. If registration fails, the Panel stays installed and the private SQL data remains; retry **Install Panel** or use the database menu. An engine/password change on an existing local instance requires a separate migration.

The final card shows **host, port, provisioning username and password** and writes a root-only report at `/opt/pterodactyl-installer/game-database-credentials.json` (mode 0600). Advanced setup lets you enter your own manager/password, with confirmation. These credentials are for the Panel to create game accounts; **do not give them to game users**. They differ from the Panel's application DB credentials.

An advanced setup can link the host to an existing numeric node ID. Leave it at **0** to register a global host when the first node has not been created. Each game server still needs a **database limit greater than zero** in the Panel. Then creating a database from that server's Databases page generates its separate database/user; setup does not invent a first game server.

Local SQL data lives outside the Panel project at `/opt/pterodactyl-installer/game-databases/`. **Removing or purging Panel/Wings preserves this project, its data, SQL service, firewall and connection report.** Game databases may still serve running games. Menu option 22 backs up this instance separately, briefly stopping SQL for a consistent physical copy and restarting it if it was running. Keep the archive and checksum off the host. Remote-host backups remain your responsibility.

A physical game-SQL backup contains its original pinned image/configuration, manager/root credentials and raw data. Use **Restore game databases** for a guided restore into an empty managed destination. The restore verifies the original image/native version and private network. For manual recovery: verify the checksum; stop the game SQL project; safely extract into an empty managed directory with ownership preserved; recreate the same private bridge/gateway and firewall; then start the **original pinned image**. Rewrite absolute bind paths only when restoring to a different root. Restore the Panel backup as well to retain its database-host records and encrypted game passwords. Do not restore raw files into a different engine/version. Full cross-host restore has not been validated; the remaining integration coverage is tracked in [the roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## First node and game server

1. Complete Panel installation and sign in with the administrator created by the wizard.
2. Create a location and a node in the Panel. Set its FQDN/IP, SSL, API/SFTP ports, memory and disk.
3. Add allocations using the node's reachable IP and your chosen game ports.
4. Generate a token under `Nodes → Configuration → Auto-Deploy`. The Wings wizard asks for the Panel URL, numeric node ID and hidden token. Paste the token itself, not the full shell command.
5. If using HTTPS, enable SSL in the node and use `/etc/letsencrypt/live/NODE_DOMAIN/fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem`. Issue the certificate from the menu and synchronize the node configuration again if you changed its SSL settings.
6. Check that the node is connected in the Panel, then create a test game server using an egg/image compatible with your CPU architecture.

Wings can be installed on the Panel machine or another node. If you postpone linking it, it remains **pending and stopped**. Use **Create node and allocations** to collect and create these resources automatically, or keep the existing token-based linking flow. [Node setup and remote provisioning](ADVANCED.md).

The node API is accessed over verified HTTPS without putting the Auto-Deploy token in process arguments. JSON is written as valid YAML and Wings normalizes it on startup. Only the remote fields allowed by Wings' `PanelConfiguration` are accepted. Relinking creates a fresh node configuration after backing up the previous one; reapply custom host settings from that copy if needed.

## Operations menu

| Option | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| 1–3 | Install Panel + Wings / Panel / Wings |
| 4–6 | Uninstall Panel + Wings / Panel / Wings |
| 7–8 | Update Panel / Wings |
| 9–10 | Link Wings / issue Wings HTTPS certificate |
| 11–13 | Back up Panel / Wings configuration / restore Panel |
| 14–16 | Diagnostics / restart / logs |
| 17–19 | SMTP / administrator / ports and firewall |
| 20–22 | Configure game SQL host / view its credentials / back up local game databases |
| 23 | Change language |
| 0 | Exit |

In the TUI, these operations are grouped under **Install**, **Maintenance**, **Game databases**, **Backups**, **Remove** and **Preferences**. The numbers below are stable keyboard shortcuts and the layout used by `--plain`.

These operations are also available as direct commands: `install-all`, `install-panel`, `install-wings`, `uninstall-all`, `uninstall-panel`, `uninstall-wings`, `update-panel`, `update-wings`, `configure-wings`, `tls-wings`, `backup-panel`, `backup-wings`, `restore-panel`, `diagnose`, `restart`, `logs`, `smtp`, `admin`, `firewall`, `configure-database`, `database-credentials`, and `backup-game-database`. Confirmations still apply.

## Backups, updates and removal

Panel backups contain SQL, original application keys, Redis and persistent configuration. Standalone backups also include the complete application; its Panel certificate/account state is kept in a dedicated managed Certbot directory. Backups pause the Panel's workers/web access and Redis as appropriate, and recover previously running services when an operation fails. Each archive has a `.sha256` companion; retain both and store a copy off the server.

**Panel and Wings-configuration backups do not include game SQL data, game worlds, game files or game backups.** Use `backup-game-database` for the managed local SQL instance. Back those up through Pterodactyl or your node backup system.

Restoration requires empty managed Panel/application directories and preserves the original APP_KEY/HASHIDS_SALT. Standalone restore also requires an empty private Redis directory. The backup's deployment method and database engine are restored; this is not a Docker ↔ standalone or MySQL ↔ MariaDB migration tool. Keep the original domain/IP/DNS or explicitly adapt the configuration afterward.

Panel updates make a backup before migration. A failed migration leaves the new code offline/in maintenance, with a recovery backup path. Resume via Install Panel, or restore the backup into a clean target. Code is not automatically downgraded onto a potentially changed schema. Wings updates recover the previous executable/image and node configuration if startup fails.

Uninstall Panel backs it up first and preserves data by default. Permanent data deletion requires another written confirmation and a successful backup. Uninstall Wings backs up configuration, removes only its daemon/service container and keeps game containers, worlds, Docker and certificates. Games can remain running after removing Wings; stop them from the Panel first if that is your intention. No global Docker prune or volume deletion is performed.

Panel HTTPS renews inside its Docker image or through its dedicated standalone Certbot timer. Wings certificates renew through host Certbot with a daemon/container restart hook. When sharing a host with the Docker Panel, Wings' standalone certificate challenge briefly pauses that Panel to free port 80. With a standalone NGINX Panel, it uses an ACME webroot without that pause.

| Runtime path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/pterodactyl-installer/panel/` | Private state, Compose/data or standalone certificate state |
| `/opt/pterodactyl-installer/game-databases/` | Independent game SQL project, data, privileged state and firewall script |
| `/opt/pterodactyl-installer/game-database-credentials.json` | Private game SQL provisioning connection report |
| `/var/www/pterodactyl/` | Standalone application; its original keys are in `.env` |
| `/var/lib/pterodactyl-installer/redis/` | Standalone private Redis persistence |
| `/etc/pterodactyl/config.yml` | Private Wings node configuration |
| `/opt/pterodactyl-installer/wings-compose.json` | Optional Wings container project |
| `/var/backups/pterodactyl-installer/` | Private backups |
| `/var/log/pterodactyl-installer/installer.log` | Private, redacted installer log |
| `/var/lib/pterodactyl/` | Wings game data; preserved on removal |

For Docker Panel installations, keep an off-server copy of `/opt/pterodactyl-installer/panel/data/var/.env`. For standalone, preserve `/var/www/pterodactyl/.env`. Losing original application keys makes encrypted data unrecoverable even with a SQL backup.

## Testing and building

```bash
python3 scripts/build_catalog.py
python3 scripts/build_language_packs.py
bash tests/run.sh
# Optional upstream release/binary checks:
bash tests/run.sh --live
# After publishing: actual GitHub downloads and language changes, no service installation
python3 tests/published_check.py
python3 scripts/build_release.py
```

TUI tests use real pseudoterminals for keyboard navigation, masked fields, resize, animation, fresh-machine diagnostics and terminal restoration after cancellation/Ctrl+C. Distribution tests run the real Bash bootstrap against recorded GitHub URL fixtures, exercise all three selected packages and subsequent language downloads, and reject missing/corrupt/unsafe archives. They also require committed language packages to match the shared source exactly. The local suite uses temporary paths and simulated package/service commands, plus the real Compose parser, NGINX/PHP syntax validation and a disposable MariaDB instance using only a temporary Unix socket when those binaries are available. Remote checks verify official release artifacts, execute Wings' `version`/`configure` against a local mock API, extract the real Panel release and inspect OCI manifests. These checks do **not** install Pterodactyl on the test host.

Full clean-VPS deployments, public certificates, email delivery and running a game still need the integration procedure in [docs/TESTING.md](TESTING.md). See [test-results/REPORT.md](../test-results/REPORT.md) for exactly what was executed. No production readiness claim is made from simulated service tests.
