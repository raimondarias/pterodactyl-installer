# Implementation status and next validation

Implemented areas include disposable integration tooling, automatic first-node creation, encrypted scheduled Panel/Wings-configuration backups, guided Panel restore, persisted resume phases, expanded health checks, isolated native game SQL and verified SSH provisioning of remote nodes/SQL. Hosted game file/database backups and restores are outside this installer’s scope. See [advanced operations](ADVANCED.md) for their contracts and limits.

Remaining validation and expansion:

1. Add ARM64 runners to the completed 18-case amd64 Ubuntu/Debian × standalone/Docker × MariaDB/MySQL matrix. Keep failures visible and attach only redacted artifacts.
2. Test S3 and SFTP against independent off-server infrastructure; current encrypted repository roundtrips use isolated local storage.
3. Test remote routing and firewall behavior between independent VPSes. Local SSH/VM tests do not prove provider networking.
4. Add configured notification destinations for failed backups and health checks.
5. Expand recovery from saved installation phases into explicit guided update rollback, with schema-compatible backup restoration.
